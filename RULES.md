# Malvernis Sector Campaign Rules

## Campaign Overview

Welcome to the Malvernis Sector campaign! Fight for control over the Malvernis sector, located in the Veiled Region of Segmentum Tempestus in the galactic south of Imperium Sanctus. 

While scarce, planets in this sector are highly valued for their resources and technological artefacts, so factions galaxy-wide have found themselves focusing on this narrow corner of space.

There are three planets in this sector to gain and maintain control over:
- **Sirephus**
- **Mythara** 
- **Veltraxis**

As you play games and win, you'll gain more control over these planets, allowing you to bring larger forces to the battlefield. Likewise, if your opponents have a high level of control over a planet, you can summon a larger fighting force to try and wrest control back.

### Multi-Faction Gameplay

This campaign allows you to play as multiple different factions throughout the league! You're not locked into a single army - feel free to experiment with different forces as you fight for control of the sector. Whether you want to lead the Imperium's finest one week and command xenos forces the next, the choice is yours. This flexibility lets you explore different playstyles while still contributing to the overall campaign narrative.

## Control Thresholds & Battle Sizes

The size of the force you can bring to each planet is determined by your faction's control level:

| Control Threshold | Max Battle Size |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| <20%              | 500pts          |
| ≥20%              | 1000pts         |
| ≥30%              | 1500pts         |
| ≥40%              | 2000pts         |

**Note:** Only one force per battle needs to meet the control threshold.

## Planetary Effects

Every week, planets will have random effects applied to them that can dramatically change the nature of battles fought there.

**Example Effect - Bloodlust:** You are eligible to charge within 18" instead of 12". When you charge, roll 3d6 instead of 2d6.

### Using Planetary Effects

- Effects are optional - you and your opponent must agree to use them
- Effects work best when known before army building, as they can significantly influence force composition
- If an effect would make the game less enjoyable, feel free to ignore it
