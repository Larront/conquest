In this league you'll be fighting over the Malvernis sector, located in the Veiled Region of Segmentum Tempestus in the galactic south of Imperium Sanctus. While scarce, planets in this sector are highly valued for their resources and technological artefacts, so factions galaxy wide have found themselves focusing on this narrow corner of space. There are three planets in this sector to gain and maintain control over - Sirephus, Mythara and Veltraxis. As you play games and win, you'll gain more control over these planets, allowing you to bring larger forces to the battlefield. Likewise, if your opponents have a high level of control over a planet, you can summon a larger fighting force to try and wrest control back. The size of the force you can bring to each planet is as shown:
Control Threshold Max Battle Size
<20% 500pts
≥20% 1000pts
≥30% 1500pts
≥40% 2000pts
Only one force per battle needs to meet the control threshold

Planetary Effects: Every week, planets will have a random effect applied to them (e.g. Bloodlust: You are eligible to charge within 18" instead of 12". When you charge, roll 3d6 instead of 2d6). If you and your opponent agree, you can apply this effect to your game. This works best if you know these effects before you build your army, as they can have a large influence on what forces you may want to bring to the battle. Otherwise if you feel that the effect isn't going to make the game fun for you or your opponent you can ignore the effect.
